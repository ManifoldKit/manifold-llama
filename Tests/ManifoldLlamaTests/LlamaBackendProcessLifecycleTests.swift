/// Regression coverage for the process-scoped latch in
/// ``LlamaBackendProcessLifecycle`` (#1319 / #1115).
///
/// Earlier revisions refcounted retain/release pairs and called
/// `llama_backend_free()` when the count hit zero, then re-entered
/// `llama_backend_init()` on the next retain. That cycle is the documented
/// llama.cpp UB (see `docs/LLAMA_CONTRACT.md` "Global Backend Lifecycle")
/// and was the source of the cross-test flakes that the previously-existing
/// `scripts/test-llama-isolated.sh` worked around per-class.
///
/// The fix is a high-watermark latch: init exactly once per process; never
/// free. This suite pins the invariant so a future refactor that re-adds
/// the `llama_backend_free()` call (or otherwise lets the latch flip back
/// to `false`) is caught by CI rather than by intermittent flakes in
/// unrelated suites.
///
/// Sabotage check: re-enable the `if refCount == 0 { llama_backend_free() }`
/// branch in `release()` — the second retain/release pair below will flip
/// `_isInitializedForTesting` between calls and the assertions fail.
