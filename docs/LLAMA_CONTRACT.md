# LlamaSwift xcframework — llama.cpp C API Contract

This document describes every `llama_*` C symbol called by the `ManifoldLlama`
target (`Sources/ManifoldLlama/`), covering threading constraints, ordering
invariants, capacity limits, ownership semantics, and known failure modes. It
is generated from a careful read of `LlamaBackend.swift`,
`LlamaGenerationDriver.swift`, `LlamaModelLoader.swift`,
`LlamaEmbeddingBackend.swift`, and the vendored `docs/vendor/llama.h` (llama.cpp
build **b9744**; the public C API header is byte-identical to b9553, so the
contract tables below are unchanged). The xcframework is consumed **directly from the upstream
`ggml-org/llama.cpp` GitHub releases** via a local `.binaryTarget(url:checksum:)`
in `Package.swift` — there is no `mattt/llama.swift` wrapper in the dependency
graph anymore (see *Binary vs. Vendored Source* below).

Use this document when upgrading the xcframework pin: diff `docs/vendor/llama.h`
against the new version's header, then review every section below for contract
changes before merging.

## Symbol coverage

`grep llama_ Sources/ManifoldLlama/*.swift | grep -oE "llama_[a-z_]+" | sort -u`
enumerates **56 distinct symbols**. Section coverage below is grouped by
subsystem; every called symbol must have a row in one of the tables. The
"Sampling" section in particular covers the full chain — `dry`, `xtc`,
`mirostat_v2`, `greedy`, and `grammar` are configurable stages, not legacy
options.

## Global Backend Lifecycle

### `llama_backend_init`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `void llama_backend_init(void)` |
| Threading | Call exactly once before any other llama.cpp call. `LlamaBackendProcessLifecycle` enforces this with a process-scoped latch (`didInitialize`) guarded by `NSLock`. |
| Ordering | Must precede all other `llama_*` calls. `llama_backend_free` is intentionally never called — see below. |
| Limits | Single global call — calling more than once is undefined behaviour in llama.cpp internals (GGML/BLAS global init). |
| Ownership | Void — no return value to manage. |
| Failure modes | None exposed; failure inside GGML (e.g., Metal unavailable) is either silently degraded or aborts internally. |

### `llama_backend_free`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `void llama_backend_free(void)` |
| Threading | **Intentionally never called.** Process exit reclaims the GGML globals; calling it ourselves would create a future `llama_backend_init` cycle, which is documented UB. |
| Ordering | Would have to be the last `llama_*` call. Earlier revisions called this when a retain/release refcount hit zero; in test suites the count routinely dipped to zero between tests, re-entering `llama_backend_init` on the next retain and accumulating GGML/Metal global state across re-inits (the cross-test flakes tracked in #1319 / #1115). The latch in `LlamaBackendProcessLifecycle` ships init exactly once per process and lets the OS reclaim at `exit()`. |
| Limits | Symmetric with `llama_backend_init` — and that symmetry is the trap. |
| Ownership | Void. |
| Failure modes | Calling when contexts or models are still alive can cause GGML internal assertion failures or resource leaks. |

---

## Model Loading

### `llama_model_default_params`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `struct llama_model_params llama_model_default_params(void)` |
| Threading | Thread-safe; pure value return, no global state. |
| Ordering | Call before `llama_model_load_from_file`. |
| Limits | None. |
| Ownership | Returns a value type (struct), no heap allocation. |
| Failure modes | None. |

**Fields set by `LlamaBackend`:**
- `n_gpu_layers = 0` in simulator (Metal unreliable); `99` otherwise (offload all layers). On non-simulator hosts, setting `LLAMA_FORCE_CPU_ONLY=1` in the process environment forces `n_gpu_layers = 0` for memory-constrained loads of very large MoE models that cannot fit their Metal partial-weight buffers — the default `99` is ~8× faster on a 4B GGUF (measured 2.28 s vs 0.28 s on `test_countTokens_…` against Qwen3-4B-Q4_K_M, M5/24 GB).
- `progress_callback` / `progress_callback_user_data`: set when a load-progress handler is installed. The callback fires on the loader thread; `LlamaBackend` bridges to async Swift via an unstructured `Task`. The `Unmanaged` retain on `ProgressCallbackContext` is released in a `defer` block after `llama_model_load_from_file` returns, so the C callback cannot fire after that point.

### `llama_model_load_from_file`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `struct llama_model * llama_model_load_from_file(const char * path_model, struct llama_model_params params)` |
| Threading | **Not safe to call concurrently with itself or `llama_model_free`.** `LlamaBackend` serialises calls with `loadSerializationLock`. |
| Ordering | `llama_backend_init` must have been called. Returns `NULL` on failure. |
| Limits | Reads the entire GGUF file from disk; respects `n_gpu_layers`. Can take several seconds on large models. |
| Ownership | Returns a heap-allocated `llama_model *`. **Caller owns it** and must eventually call `llama_model_free`. `LlamaBackend` wraps this in `LlamaModelHandle` for automatic RAII cleanup on error paths. |
| Failure modes | Returns `NULL` on file-not-found, corrupt GGUF, or memory exhaustion. `LlamaBackend` throws `InferenceError.modelLoadFailed` when `NULL` is returned. |

### `llama_model_free`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `void llama_model_free(struct llama_model * model)` |
| Threading | **Not safe to call concurrently with `llama_model_load_from_file`.** Call only after all contexts created from this model have been freed. |
| Ordering | All `llama_context *` objects derived from this model must already be freed before `llama_model_free`. In `LlamaBackend`, `unloadModel()` frees context first (`llama_free`), then model (`llama_model_free`). |
| Limits | None. |
| Ownership | Frees and invalidates the pointer. |
| Failure modes | Double-free or use-after-free if called while a context or generation task is still active — guarded by awaiting `capturedTask` in `unloadModel()`'s cleanup task. |

---

## Vocabulary

### `llama_model_get_vocab`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `const struct llama_vocab * llama_model_get_vocab(const struct llama_model * model)` |
| Threading | Thread-safe; returns a pointer into model-owned memory. |
| Ordering | Model must be loaded. Pointer is valid as long as the model is alive. |
| Limits | None. |
| Ownership | **Borrowed reference** — do not free. `LlamaBackend` stores this in `vocab` and clears it alongside the model. |
| Failure modes | Returns `NULL` if the model has no vocabulary (rare; only affects embedding models). `LlamaBackend` guards `vocab != nil` before every tokenization call. |

---

## Context Lifecycle

### `llama_context_default_params`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `struct llama_context_params llama_context_default_params(void)` |
| Threading | Thread-safe; pure value return. |
| Ordering | Call before `llama_init_from_model`. |
| Limits | Default `n_batch` is 2048; default `n_ctx` is 0 (inherits from model). |
| Ownership | Value type, no heap allocation. |
| Failure modes | None. |

**Fields set by `LlamaBackend`:**
- `n_ctx`: set from `plan.effectiveContextSize` — the `ModelLoadPlan` is authoritative; no in-backend clamping.
- `n_threads` / `n_threads_batch`: `max(1, min(8, processorCount - 2))`.
- `n_batch`: **not set** — inherits default (2048). See known violation history below.

### `llama_init_from_model`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `struct llama_context * llama_init_from_model(struct llama_model * model, struct llama_context_params params)` |
| Threading | Not safe to call concurrently on the same model. |
| Ordering | Model must be loaded. Must precede any `llama_decode` / `llama_tokenize` / sampler calls. |
| Limits | Allocates KV cache for `n_ctx` tokens. The actual context used may differ from `params.n_ctx` — always query `llama_n_ctx(ctx)` for the real value (see header comment at line 546–548 of `llama.h`). `n_batch` must be ≤ `n_ctx`. |
| Ownership | Returns a heap-allocated `llama_context *`. **Caller owns it** and must call `llama_free`. Wrapped in `LlamaContextHandle` for RAII. |
| Failure modes | Returns `NULL` on memory exhaustion. `LlamaBackend` throws `InferenceError.modelLoadFailed` with a specific message asking the caller to retry with a smaller context size. |

### `llama_free`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `void llama_free(struct llama_context * ctx)` |
| Threading | Must not be called while any generation task is using the context. `LlamaBackend` awaits `capturedTask` before calling. |
| Ordering | Must precede `llama_model_free`. |
| Limits | None. |
| Ownership | Frees and invalidates all resources allocated for the context, including the KV cache. |
| Failure modes | Use-after-free if called while `llama_decode` is executing on the same context — prevented by the task lifecycle protocol in `unloadModel()`. |

---

## Context Introspection

### `llama_n_batch`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `uint32_t llama_n_batch(const struct llama_context * ctx)` |
| Threading | Thread-safe read. |
| Ordering | Context must be initialised. |
| Limits | Returns the logical max batch size set at context creation (default 2048). `llama_decode` asserts `n_tokens <= n_batch`; exceeding this triggers an internal `GGML_ASSERT`. |
| Ownership | Returns a value. No allocation. |
| Failure modes | None; but the value directly constrains `llama_decode` — see violation history. |

### Other context/model accessors (compact)

| Symbol | Returns | Threading | Notes |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| `llama_n_ctx(ctx)` | `uint32_t` | safe read | Authoritative context size — may differ from `ctxParams.n_ctx`; query rather than assume. |
| `llama_get_model(ctx)` | `const llama_model *` | safe read | Borrowed pointer back to the owning model; do not free. Used by `LlamaGenerationDriver` to read `n_ctx_train` when configuring DRY. |
| `llama_model_n_ctx_train(model)` | `int32_t` | safe read | Training-time context size; feeds `DRYSamplerDescriptor`. |
| `llama_model_n_embd(model)` | `int32_t` | safe read | Embedding dimensionality; used by `LlamaEmbeddingBackend` to size output buffers. |
| `llama_model_meta_val_str(model, key, buf, len)` | `int32_t` | safe read | Reads GGUF metadata strings (e.g. chat template); negative return signals "key not present" or buffer too small. Caller must retry-on-negative. |

---

## Memory / KV Cache

### `llama_get_memory`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `llama_memory_t llama_get_memory(const struct llama_context * ctx)` |
| Threading | Thread-safe read. |
| Ordering | Context must be initialised. |
| Limits | May return `NULL` for contexts that have no memory (e.g., embedding-only contexts). |
| Ownership | Borrowed reference into context-owned memory. Do not free. |
| Failure modes | Callers must guard against `NULL`; `LlamaBackend` wraps in `if let memory = ...`. |

### `llama_memory_clear`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `void llama_memory_clear(llama_memory_t mem, bool data)` |
| Threading | Must not be called concurrently with `llama_decode`. |
| Ordering | Requires a non-`NULL` memory handle. Called at the start of every generation run in `LlamaBackend` to prevent KV state from a prior (possibly cancelled) run from colliding with the new run's token positions. |
| Limits | When `data = false`, clears metadata (positions, sequence IDs) but not the raw weight buffers — this is what `LlamaBackend` uses. `data = true` also zeros the weight data, which is more expensive. |
| Ownership | Void. No new allocation. |
| Failure modes | None; incorrect use (not clearing after cancellation) is a correctness bug, not a crash — see violation history (PR #396). |

### `llama_memory_seq_rm`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `void llama_memory_seq_rm(llama_memory_t mem, llama_seq_id seq_id, llama_pos p0, llama_pos p1)` |
| Threading | Must not be called concurrently with `llama_decode` on the same context. |
| Ordering | Used at the start of a generation run when the new prompt shares a prefix of length `reuseLen` with the previous decode (`LlamaBackend.swift:384`). Trims the KV tail past `p0 = reuseLen` so the suffix can be re-decoded starting at the correct position. `p1 = -1` means "to end". |
| Limits | The reused prefix must be byte-identical to the previously-decoded prompt; otherwise the surviving KV entries are stale and produce garbage logits. The backend recomputes the longest shared prefix per call. |
| Ownership | Void. |
| Failure modes | Silent correctness bug if `reuseLen` overstates the shared prefix. See Invariant #3 for the seed-determinism caveat introduced by the partial re-decode path. |

---

## Batching and Decoding

### `llama_batch_init`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `struct llama_batch llama_batch_init(int32_t n_tokens, int32_t embd, int32_t n_seq_max)` |
| Threading | Thread-safe. |
| Ordering | Must be matched with `llama_batch_free`. |
| Limits | `n_tokens` must not exceed `llama_n_batch(ctx)` when passed to `llama_decode`. `LlamaBackend` queries `llama_n_batch` and processes prompts in chunks of at most that size. |
| Ownership | Allocates heap memory for all batch fields. Caller must free with `llama_batch_free`. `LlamaBackend` always calls `llama_batch_free` immediately after `llama_decode` in the prompt loop, and uses `defer` for the generation batch. |
| Failure modes | Passing `n_tokens > n_batch` to `llama_decode` triggers `GGML_ASSERT` and crashes the process. |

### `llama_batch_free`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `void llama_batch_free(struct llama_batch batch)` |
| Threading | Thread-safe. |
| Ordering | Must be called for every batch created with `llama_batch_init`. |
| Limits | None. |
| Ownership | Frees batch-internal buffers. The struct is passed by value so the caller's copy is left dangling — do not use after `llama_batch_free`. |
| Failure modes | Memory leak if not called. |

### `llama_decode`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `int32_t llama_decode(struct llama_context * ctx, struct llama_batch batch)` |
| Threading | **Not thread-safe on the same context.** `LlamaBackend` runs all decode calls from a single `Task`; the context pointer is captured under `stateLock` and never shared between tasks. |
| Ordering | KV cache must not be corrupt from a prior cancelled run — clear with `llama_memory_clear` first. `batch.n_tokens` must be ≤ `llama_n_batch(ctx)`. `batch.logits[i]` must be set correctly: only positions from which logits are needed should have `logits = 1`. |
| Limits | Returns `0` on success, `1` if no KV slot is available (non-fatal), `-1` for invalid input, `< -1` for fatal error. LlamaBackend treats any non-zero return as a failure. |
| Ownership | Does not take ownership of the batch. |
| Failure modes | `GGML_ASSERT` crash if `batch.n_tokens > n_batch` — the historic violation that PR #409 fixed by introducing chunked prompt decoding. Returns non-zero on KV slot exhaustion; this typically indicates context window overflow rather than a logic bug. |

---

## Sampling

### `llama_sampler_chain_default_params`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `struct llama_sampler_chain_params llama_sampler_chain_default_params(void)` |
| Threading | Thread-safe; pure value. |
| Ordering | Call before `llama_sampler_chain_init`. |
| Limits | None. |
| Ownership | Value type. |
| Failure modes | None. |

### `llama_sampler_chain_init`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `struct llama_sampler * llama_sampler_chain_init(struct llama_sampler_chain_params params)` |
| Threading | Thread-safe. |
| Ordering | Must precede `llama_sampler_chain_add` and `llama_sampler_sample`. Must be freed with `llama_sampler_free`. |
| Limits | Returns `NULL` on allocation failure (extremely rare). |
| Ownership | Returns a heap-allocated sampler chain. **Caller owns it.** `LlamaBackend` frees via `defer { llama_sampler_free(sampler) }`. |
| Failure modes | `NULL` return checked; `LlamaBackend` throws `InferenceError.inferenceFailure` if `NULL`. |

### `llama_sampler_chain_add`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `void llama_sampler_chain_add(struct llama_sampler * chain, struct llama_sampler * smpl)` |
| Threading | Not safe to call concurrently on the same chain. |
| Ordering | Chain must be initialised. **Takes ownership of `smpl`** — the chain frees child samplers when `llama_sampler_free` is called on the chain. Do not call `llama_sampler_free` separately on any added sampler. |
| Limits | Order matters: penalties → top_k → top_p → min_p → temp → dist (as set in `LlamaBackend`). |
| Ownership | Transfer: chain owns `smpl` after this call. |
| Failure modes | None. |

### `llama_sampler_free`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `void llama_sampler_free(struct llama_sampler * smpl)` |
| Threading | Must not be called while `llama_sampler_sample` is executing. |
| Ordering | For a chain, also frees all child samplers added via `llama_sampler_chain_add`. |
| Limits | **Do not call on a sampler that has been added to a chain** — that results in double-free. |
| Ownership | Frees and invalidates the sampler. |
| Failure modes | Double-free crash if called on a chain-owned sampler. |

### `llama_sampler_init_penalties`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `struct llama_sampler * llama_sampler_init_penalties(int32_t penalty_last_n, float penalty_repeat, float penalty_freq, float penalty_present)` |
| Threading | Thread-safe construction. |
| Ordering | Add to chain before sampling. |
| Limits | `penalty_last_n`: window of recent tokens to penalise; `0` disables. Avoid on full vocabulary — O(vocab_size × penalty_last_n) per step. |
| Ownership | Returned pointer transferred to chain via `llama_sampler_chain_add`. |
| Failure modes | None. |

### `llama_sampler_init_top_k`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `struct llama_sampler * llama_sampler_init_top_k(int32_t k)` |
| Threading | Thread-safe construction. |
| Ordering | Add to chain before sampling. Typically before top_p/min_p. |
| Limits | `k <= 0` makes this a no-op. `LlamaBackend` passes `40`. |
| Ownership | Transferred to chain. |
| Failure modes | None. |

### `llama_sampler_init_top_p`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `struct llama_sampler * llama_sampler_init_top_p(float p, size_t min_keep)` |
| Threading | Thread-safe construction. |
| Ordering | After top_k, before temp. |
| Limits | `p = 1.0` is a no-op (all tokens kept). `min_keep` ensures at least that many candidates survive; `LlamaBackend` uses `1`. |
| Ownership | Transferred to chain. |
| Failure modes | None. |

### `llama_sampler_init_min_p`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `struct llama_sampler * llama_sampler_init_min_p(float p, size_t min_keep)` |
| Threading | Thread-safe construction. |
| Ordering | After top_p, before temp. |
| Limits | Removes tokens with probability below `p * max_probability`. `LlamaBackend` uses `p = 0.05`, `min_keep = 1`. |
| Ownership | Transferred to chain. |
| Failure modes | None. |

### `llama_sampler_init_temp`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `struct llama_sampler * llama_sampler_init_temp(float t)` |
| Threading | Thread-safe construction. |
| Ordering | After top_p/min_p, before dist. |
| Limits | `t = 1.0` is neutral. `t → 0` makes distribution increasingly deterministic. |
| Ownership | Transferred to chain. |
| Failure modes | None. |

### `llama_sampler_init_dist`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `struct llama_sampler * llama_sampler_init_dist(uint32_t seed)` |
| Threading | Thread-safe construction. |
| Ordering | Must be last in the chain — it selects a token, not a filter. |
| Limits | `seed = LLAMA_DEFAULT_SEED` (0xFFFFFFFF) picks a random seed. `LlamaBackend` uses `UInt32.random(in: 0...UInt32.max)` for per-session variety. |
| Ownership | Transferred to chain. |
| Failure modes | None. |

### `llama_sampler_sample`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `llama_token llama_sampler_sample(struct llama_sampler * smpl, struct llama_context * ctx, int32_t idx)` |
| Threading | Not thread-safe on the same context+sampler pair. |
| Ordering | Must be called after a successful `llama_decode`. `idx = -1` reads logits from the last token of the most recent decode (used on the first generation iteration); `idx = 0` reads from index 0 of a 1-token batch (used on subsequent iterations). |
| Limits | `idx` is relative to the logit matrix from the last decode; out-of-range values are undefined behaviour. |
| Ownership | Returns a `llama_token` (int32). No heap allocation. |
| Failure modes | Undefined behaviour if `llama_batch.logits[idx]` was `0` during decode (logits not requested for that position). `LlamaBackend` ensures `logits[last_token] = 1` in the prompt chunk and `logits[0] = 1` in every generation batch. The automatic chain-accept step internally calls `llama_grammar_accept_token` when a grammar sampler is present — this throws `std::runtime_error: Unexpected empty grammar stack` across the C ABI if the grammar stage is mis-ordered relative to the probability filters (see Violation #6). |

### Optional sampler stages (compact)

Stages added to the chain only when the corresponding `GenerationConfig`
fields request them. Every entry is transferred to the chain by
`llama_sampler_chain_add` and freed by the chain's `llama_sampler_free`.

| Symbol | Inserted when | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| `llama_sampler_init_grammar(vocab, gbnf, root)` | `config.grammar != nil` | Must come **before** all probability filters (penalties → grammar → …) or `llama_grammar_accept_token` aborts via libc++abi. See Violation #6. |
| `llama_sampler_init_dry(vocab, n_ctx_train, multiplier, base, allowed_length, penalty_last_n, seq_breakers, n_breakers)` | `DRYSamplerDescriptor` resolves non-nil | DRY repetition penalty; `seq_breakers` is a `withCStringArray`-backed buffer that must outlive the call. |
| `llama_sampler_init_greedy()` | `config.temperature <= 0.0` | Replaces the entire `temp → xtc → dist` tail. Eliminates seed-dependent tie-breaking on the KV-reuse path (see Invariant #1). |
| `llama_sampler_init_mirostat_v2(seed, tau, eta)` | `MirostatV2SamplerDescriptor` resolves non-nil | **Replaces** `temp → xtc → dist`; never run alongside them (Invariant #2). |
| `llama_sampler_init_xtc(probability, threshold, min_keep, seed)` | `XTCSamplerDescriptor` resolves non-nil | Sits between `temp` and `dist` only when Mirostat v2 is inactive. |

---

## GPU Synchronisation

### `llama_synchronize`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `void llama_synchronize(struct llama_context * ctx)` |
| Threading | Safe to call from any thread that is not concurrently invoking `llama_decode`/`llama_encode` on the same context. |
| Ordering | Must be called at **every** exit path of a generation run before returning control: normal completion, mid-prompt cancellation, prompt-decode failure, and in-loop decode failure. `LlamaGenerationDriver.swift:377/387/596/637` and `LlamaEmbeddingBackend.swift:169` are the authoritative callsites. |
| Limits | Blocks the calling thread until the GPU is idle — sub-millisecond when the GPU has already drained, longer when a long command buffer is in flight. |
| Ownership | Void. |
| Failure modes | Skipping the call lets Metal command buffers from the previous run overlap with the KV-clear at the start of the next run, tripping `GGML_ASSERT([rsets->data count] == 0)` in `ggml-metal-device.m`. See Violation #5. |

---

## Tokenization

### `llama_tokenize`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `int32_t llama_tokenize(const struct llama_vocab * vocab, const char * text, int32_t text_len, llama_token * tokens, int32_t n_tokens_max, bool add_special, bool parse_special)` |
| Threading | **Thread-safe** — pure vocabulary lookup, no context state. |
| Ordering | Vocabulary pointer must be valid (model loaded). |
| Limits | Returns the token count on success (≤ `n_tokens_max`); returns a negative number (negated required size) if the buffer is too small; returns `INT32_MIN` on overflow. `LlamaBackend` allocates `text.utf8CString.count + (addBos ? 1 : 0)` tokens — `utf8CString.count` is the null-terminated byte count (`text.utf8.count + 1`), and one extra slot is reserved for the BOS token when `addBos = true`. This is always sufficient. |
| Ownership | Writes into caller-provided `tokens` buffer. No heap allocation. |
| Failure modes | Negative return means buffer too small — `LlamaBackend` treats negative return as failure and returns an empty array (causing `InferenceError.inferenceFailure("Failed to tokenize prompt")`). |

### `llama_token_to_piece`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `int32_t llama_token_to_piece(const struct llama_vocab * vocab, llama_token token, char * buf, int32_t length, int32_t lstrip, bool special)` |
| Threading | Thread-safe — pure vocabulary lookup. |
| Ordering | Vocabulary must be valid. |
| Limits | Returns byte count on success; returns negated required size if buffer too small. `LlamaBackend` starts with a 32-byte buffer and retries on negative return. |
| Ownership | Writes into caller-provided buffer. Does not write a null terminator. |
| Failure modes | Negative return on buffer too small — `LlamaBackend` retries with the correct size. Multi-byte UTF-8 sequences can span token boundaries; `LlamaBackend` accumulates incomplete bytes in `invalidUTF8Buffer` and defers emission until a valid UTF-8 string can be formed. |

### `llama_vocab_is_eog`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Signature | `bool llama_vocab_is_eog(const struct llama_vocab * vocab, llama_token token)` |
| Threading | Thread-safe — pure vocabulary lookup. |
| Ordering | Vocabulary must be valid. |
| Limits | None. |
| Ownership | Returns a bool. No allocation. |
| Failure modes | None; returns `false` for non-EOG tokens including BOS. |

---

## Embedding

`LlamaEmbeddingBackend` runs a separate `llama_context` configured with
`llama_set_embeddings(ctx, true)`, drives a single `llama_encode` pass, and
reads pooled or per-token embeddings. None of these symbols are wired
through the generation backend's state machine — embedding calls bypass
`stateLock` and the cancellation flag, on the assumption that single-shot
embedding latency is bounded enough that interruption isn't required.

| Symbol | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `llama_set_embeddings(ctx, bool)` | Toggles embedding output mode on the context. Must be set before `llama_encode`. Toggling between embedding and generation on the same context is supported but unused — the codebase keeps a dedicated context. |
| `llama_encode(ctx, batch)` | Embedding-mode analogue of `llama_decode`. Returns `0` on success, non-zero on failure. `LlamaEmbeddingBackend.swift:154` falls back to `llama_decode` once if `encode` fails, then surfaces the combined return codes via `NSError`. |
| `llama_pooling_type(ctx)` | Returns the active pooling strategy (`NONE`, `MEAN`, `CLS`, `LAST`, `RANK`). Drives whether embeddings are read via `llama_get_embeddings_seq` (pooled) or `llama_get_embeddings_ith` + manual reduction. |
| `llama_get_embeddings_seq(ctx, seq_id)` | Returns a borrowed `const float *` of length `n_embd` for the pooled embedding of `seq_id = 0`. Pointer is invalidated by the next `llama_encode`/`llama_decode`. |
| `llama_get_embeddings_ith(ctx, i)` | Returns a borrowed `const float *` for the `i`-th token's embedding when pooling is `NONE`. Same invalidation rules. |

## Known Violations History

The following contract violations caused production crashes or silent
correctness bugs. Each entry links to the PR that fixed it.

### 1. `n_batch` limit overflow — fixed in PR #409

**Violation:** `llama_decode` asserts `n_tokens <= cparams.n_batch` inside
`llama-context.cpp` via `GGML_ASSERT`. Before PR #409, `LlamaBackend` passed
the entire tokenised prompt as a single batch. On models with a default
`n_batch` of 2048, prompts longer than 2048 tokens triggered the assert,
crashing the process with `SIGABRT`.

**Fix:** The prompt is now decoded in `n_batch`-sized chunks. `llama_n_batch(ctx)`
is queried once after context creation and used as the stride. Each chunk has
`logits = 0` except the last token of the final chunk, which has `logits = 1`.
Intermediate chunks are allocated and freed inside the loop to avoid
batch-reuse bugs.

**Detection signal:** `GGML_ASSERT(n_tokens_all <= cparams.n_batch)` in
llama.cpp source; SIGABRT in the host process.

### 2. `n_ctx` vs. available memory — fixed in PR #399 / `ModelLoadPlan`

**Violation:** `llama_init_from_model` allocates a KV cache sized for
`n_ctx × n_heads × head_dim × 2` (K + V). For large context sizes on devices
with limited VRAM, this caused either an out-of-memory `NULL` return or, worse,
a successful allocation followed by Metal command-buffer failures mid-generation.

**Fix:** `ModelLoadPlan` computes the maximum context size that fits in
available memory before calling the backend. `LlamaBackend.loadModel(from:plan:)`
uses `plan.effectiveContextSize` as the authoritative value and does **no
internal clamping** — the plan is the single source of truth. If
`llama_init_from_model` still returns `NULL` at that size, `LlamaBackend`
throws `InferenceError.modelLoadFailed` with an explicit message asking for a
smaller context, rather than silently retrying with a halved size (which was
the original broken behaviour).

**Detection signal:** `llama_init_from_model` returning `NULL`; Metal
`MTLDevice` allocation failures logged to the system console.

### 3. KV cache state after cancelled generation — fixed in PR #396

**Violation:** When generation was cancelled via `stopGeneration()`, the
`llama_context` KV cache retained token positions from the interrupted run.
The next call to `generate()` started filling the KV cache from position 0,
colliding with stale positions already resident. llama.cpp's KV slot allocator
could not find a valid slot, causing `llama_decode` to return `1`
(no KV slot available) immediately, producing a "Decode failed during
generation" error on the very first token.

**Fix:** `llama_memory_clear(memory, false)` is called at the start of every
generation task, after re-acquiring the context pointer under `stateLock`.
`data = false` clears metadata (positions, sequence IDs) without zeroing weight
buffers, making it fast. The call is guarded by `if let memory = llama_get_memory(context)`
to handle the rare case of a context with no memory.

**Detection signal:** `llama_decode` returning `1` immediately on the first
token of a new generation following any cancellation; "Decode failed during
generation" error in the `GenerationStream`.

### 4. `cancelled` flag data race between `stopGeneration()` and the decode loop — fixed in PR #418

**Violation:** `stopped` was a plain `Bool` guarded by `stateLock`. When
`stopGeneration()` was called from the main actor, it acquired `stateLock` to
write `cancelled = true`. The decode loop read `cancelled` via
`withStateLock { self.cancelled }` on a background task. Under Thread Sanitizer
the ordering guarantee was provided solely by `NSLock`, which TSan does not
always model as a sequentially-consistent barrier. Additionally,
`stopGeneration()` is documented as safe to call from any thread or actor (e.g.
a memory-pressure handler), but `NSLock` does not establish the
sequentially-consistent atomic ordering needed to make that guarantee airtight.

**Fix:** `private let cancelled = Atomic<Bool>(false)` (Swift 6
`Synchronization`) at `LlamaBackend.swift:97`. Every read and write uses
`.sequentiallyConsistent` ordering, making `stopGeneration()` safe to call
from any thread without acquiring `stateLock` for the flag itself. The
surrounding state (`generationTask`, `context`, `vocab`) is still guarded by
`stateLock`; see the startup-race comment at `LlamaBackend.swift:388-392` —
the lock is held across **both** `Task` creation and `generationTask`
assignment so `stopGeneration()` cannot observe a window where
`cancelled == false && isGenerating == false` simultaneously.

**Detection signal:** Historical TSan reports of a data race on `cancelled`
between the `stopGeneration()` caller thread and the generation task. Any
refactor that drops `stateLock` from the startup-race window or replaces
`Atomic<Bool>` with a plain `Bool` reintroduces this bug.

### 5. Unsynchronized Metal command buffers between consecutive `generate()` calls — fixed in this PR

**Violation:** `llama_decode` enqueues Metal compute passes asynchronously.
When `LlamaGenerationDriver.run()` returned without calling `llama_synchronize`,
the GPU could still be executing the final batch's command buffers at the time
the *next* `generate()` call began.  The KV-cache clear at the top of the new
run (`llama_memory_clear` / `llama_memory_seq_rm`) enqueues fresh Metal
operations before the previous command buffers had committed.  That ordering
violation trips llama.cpp's internal render-set assertion:

```
GGML_ASSERT([rsets->data count] == 0)   (ggml-metal-device.m:618)
Signal 5 (SIGTRAP)
Swift/ContiguousArrayBuffer.swift:692: Fatal error: Index out of range
```

The crash was model-specific (observed on llama3.1:8b, not Qwen3-4B) because
larger models produce longer Metal command buffers that are more likely to still
be in flight when the second call begins.

**Fix:** `llama_synchronize(context)` is called at every exit path of
`LlamaGenerationDriver.run()`: the normal completion path, the mid-prompt
cancellation path, the prompt-decode-failure path, and the in-loop
decode-failure path.  `llama_synchronize` blocks the calling thread until the
GPU is idle — sub-millisecond when the GPU is already done — and is the
authoritative synchronization primitive for this purpose (see `llama.h` line 972).

**Detection signal:** `GGML_ASSERT([rsets->data count] == 0)` in
`ggml-metal-device.m` on the second consecutive `generate()` call; followed by
a Swift `Fatal error: Index out of range` in `ContiguousArrayBuffer.swift`.
Regression test: `test_consecutiveGenerateCalls_doesNotCrash` in
`Tests/ManifoldE2ETests/LlamaE2ETests.swift`.

### 6. Grammar sampler ordered after probability filters — fixed during sampler-chain consolidation

**Violation:** When the GBNF grammar sampler was added to the chain *after*
`top_k` / `top_p` / `min_p`, the probability filters could narrow the
candidate pool to a set containing no grammar-valid tokens. Grammar then
masked every surviving logit to `-inf`, `dist` fell back to a numerical
default token (e.g. token 365 `(`), and the chain's automatic accept step
inside `llama_sampler_sample` called `llama_grammar_accept_token`, which
threw `std::runtime_error: Unexpected empty grammar stack` across the C ABI
and aborted the process via libc++abi.

**Fix:** Grammar is now inserted into the chain immediately after
`penalties` and **before** any probability filter
(`LlamaGenerationDriver.swift:195`):

```
penalties → grammar → dry → top_k → top_p → min_p → temp → xtc → dist
```

When Mirostat v2 is active it replaces the `temp → xtc → dist` tail with a
single `mirostat_v2` step. When `temperature <= 0.0`, the whole post-grammar
tail collapses to `llama_sampler_init_greedy()` — see Known Invariant #1
below for why.

**Detection signal:** `libc++abi: terminating with uncaught exception of
type std::runtime_error: Unexpected empty grammar stack`; regression test
`test_grammar_cancelCleansTeardown`.

---

## Known Invariants (not historic violations, but easy to break)

### 1. Greedy sampler replaces `dist` when `temperature <= 0.0`

`LlamaGenerationDriver.swift:281` swaps in `llama_sampler_init_greedy()` for
`temp/xtc/dist` whenever `config.temperature <= 0.0`. Reason: `dist` introduces
seed-dependent tie-breaking that can produce non-deterministic argmax when
two logits are numerically equal — which is a realistic case on the KV-reuse
path (see Invariant #3) because partial re-decodes use a different Metal
accumulation order than full-batch decodes. Removing the greedy branch
silently reintroduces seed-dependent non-determinism at temperature 0.

### 2. Mirostat v2 owns the chain tail

When Mirostat v2 is active (`MirostatV2SamplerDescriptor` non-nil), it
**replaces** the `temp → xtc → dist` tail rather than running alongside
those stages. Adding any of those stages while Mirostat is active produces
double-sampling and undefined chain behaviour.

### 3. Prefix KV reuse and seed determinism

`LlamaBackend.swift:384` calls `llama_memory_seq_rm(mem, 0, reuseLen, -1)`
to trim the KV tail past the longest shared prefix between the new prompt
and the previous decode. `LlamaGenerationDriver.run` skips
`llama_memory_clear` when `reuseLen > 0` and emits `.kvCacheReuse`. This is
prompt caching; it is a correctness-preserving optimisation but **not
bit-exact** with a clean decode of the same prompt — the Metal accumulation
order differs, so seeded `dist` sampling can produce different tokens
between a cold prompt and a partially-reused prompt. Callers that require
deterministic-per-seed output must either disable prefix reuse at the
backend (currently not exposed as a knob) or accept that determinism holds
only across runs with identical reuse boundaries. Temperature-zero callers
are unaffected because Invariant #1 kicks in.

## Security

### CVE-2026-2069 — Buffer overflow in `llama_grammar_advance_stack()`

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| CVE | CVE-2026-2069 |
| Affected symbol | `llama_sampler_init_grammar` → internal `llama_grammar_advance_stack()` |
| Vulnerability | A buffer overflow in the grammar stack-advance logic allowed a crafted GBNF grammar string (or a JSON Schema with certain constructs) to overflow an internal stack buffer, enabling potential arbitrary code execution. |
| Fixed in | llama.cpp build **b8774** |
| Vendored build | **b9744** (upstream `ggml-org/llama.cpp` release) — **fix is included** (b9744 ≫ b8774) |
| Status | ✅ **Mitigated in the vendored binary.** |

#### Defence in depth

`GBNFSchemaPreValidator` (`Sources/ManifoldInference/Services/GBNFSchemaPreValidator.swift`)
still runs before every `llama_sampler_init_grammar` call driven by a
tool-call `ToolDefinition.parameters` schema. Its rejection rules are
**retained post-fix** because they encode GBNF expressiveness limits, not
just the CVE PoC shapes:

- `anyOf`, `oneOf`, `allOf`, `not` — no representation in the GBNF IR; would
  surface as parse failure or empty-grammar-stack crash even on the patched
  binary.
- Nullable union types: `"type": ["string", "null"]` — produce unbounded
  alternation that overflows the grammar parse stack.
- `exclusiveMinimum` / `exclusiveMaximum` (Draft 2020-12 integer form) —
  trigger a type-confusion path in the GBNF numeric rule builder.

Callers that pass a GBNF string directly via `GenerationConfig.grammar` (not
via tool definitions) are still not covered by the pre-validator. Those
strings are now safe against the CVE on the b9744 binary, but a malformed
GBNF can still produce `llama_grammar_accept_token` aborts at sample time
(see Violation #6).

#### Upgrade procedure when re-pinning the xcframework

1. Pick the target upstream build `b<NNNN>` from the
   [`ggml-org/llama.cpp` releases](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases).
   The release asset is `llama-b<NNNN>-xcframework.zip`.
2. In `Package.swift`, update the `.binaryTarget(name: "llama-cpp", …)` `url`
   to that asset and refresh its `checksum`. The checksum is SwiftPM's package
   checksum of the zip — `swift package compute-checksum llama-b<NNNN>-xcframework.zip`
   on a local download (the same value SwiftPM verifies at resolve time). Then
   run `swift package resolve`.
3. Refresh `docs/vendor/llama.h` from the resolved xcframework
   (`.build/artifacts/manifold-llama/llama-cpp/llama.xcframework/macos-arm64_x86_64/llama.framework/Versions/A/Headers/llama.h`).
   Prepend the four-line `Read-only reference copy.` banner with the new
   build tag and the `xcframework checksum` from step 2.
4. In `GBNFSchemaPreValidator.swift`, update `CVEAuditRecord.vendoredBuild`
   to the new tag. The validation rules stay; they are not CVE-specific.
5. Diff `docs/vendor/llama.h` against the previous revision and review every
   changed symbol against the tables above.
6. Run `swift test` on Apple Silicon before opening the PR (set
   `MANIFOLD_DISCOVER_LOCAL_MODELS=1` or `LLAMA_TEST_MODEL=<path>` to exercise
   the real-model suites).

## Binary vs. Vendored Source

### Decision

The llama.cpp xcframework is consumed as a **pre-built binary, straight from
the upstream `ggml-org/llama.cpp` GitHub releases** — `Package.swift` declares a
local `.binaryTarget(name: "llama-cpp", url:checksum:)` pointing at
`llama-b<NNNN>-xcframework.zip` (currently **b9744**), and a one-file local
`LlamaSwift` target (`Sources/LlamaSwift/Llama.swift`:
`@_exported @preconcurrency import llama`) re-exports the C module so the
`ManifoldLlama` sources keep importing `LlamaSwift` unchanged. This package does
**not** compile llama.cpp from source, and **no longer depends on the
`mattt/llama.swift` wrapper** — it was dropped in favour of pinning the same
upstream asset directly (url + checksum, no git-tag resolution), which removes
the wrapper's auto-tag CI-drift hazard.

### Tradeoffs

| Factor | Binary pin | Vendored source |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Build time | Fast — no C/C++ compilation | Slow — full llama.cpp compile on every clean build |
| Metal shaders | Pre-compiled; consistent across machines | Compiled by Xcode; can diverge between Xcode versions |
| Diff on upgrade | Opaque — only `llama.h` changes are visible | Full diff available in git |
| CI compatibility | `swift test` works without Xcode | Metal shaders require Xcode for `swift test` |
| Reproducibility | Exact binary is pinned by `checksum` in `Package.swift` | Source is pinned by tag/commit |
| Debugging | Cannot step into llama.cpp internals | Full source available to debugger |

### Rationale for keeping the binary pin

The Metal shader pre-compilation is the decisive factor. Compiling llama.cpp
Metal shaders from source requires Xcode and the Metal shader compiler, which
is unavailable in headless CI environments and on non-Apple machines.
The pre-built xcframework ensures `swift test --disable-default-traits` (the
CI path) does not require Xcode, while Xcode integration tests (`ManifoldMLXIntegrationTests`)
continue to use the same pre-built binary.

The opacity of binary diffs is mitigated by two practices:
1. `docs/vendor/llama.h` is re-copied on each version bump and committed,
   giving a human-readable diff of the public API surface in code review.
2. This document (`LLAMA_CONTRACT.md`) is updated in the same PR as the
   version bump, forcing a review of every contract change against the
   sections above.

### Upgrade procedure

1. Pick the target upstream build `b<NNNN>` from the
   [`ggml-org/llama.cpp` releases](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases);
   the asset is `llama-b<NNNN>-xcframework.zip`. Update the
   `.binaryTarget(name: "llama-cpp", …)` `url` to it in `Package.swift`.
2. Refresh the `.binaryTarget` `checksum`. It is SwiftPM's package checksum of
   the zip — download the asset and run
   `swift package compute-checksum llama-b<NNNN>-xcframework.zip` (the value
   SwiftPM verifies at resolve). Then run `swift package resolve`.
3. Copy the new `llama.h` from the resolved xcframework:
   ```
   cp .build/artifacts/manifold-llama/llama-cpp/llama.xcframework/macos-arm64_x86_64/llama.framework/Versions/A/Headers/llama.h \
      docs/vendor/llama.h
   ```
   Then prepend the four-line `Read-only reference copy.` banner referencing
   the new build tag and the xcframework checksum from step 2.
4. Diff `docs/vendor/llama.h` against the previous version and review every
   changed symbol against the tables in this document.
5. Update `GBNFSchemaPreValidator.cveStatus.vendoredBuild` in
   `Sources/ManifoldInference/Services/GBNFSchemaPreValidator.swift`. Flip
   `isFixed`/`fixedAtBuild` only if a new CVE-fix boundary is crossed.
6. Update every section in this document (`LLAMA_CONTRACT.md`) that
   references the build number or whose contract has changed according to
   the `llama.h` diff from step 4. Commit `LLAMA_CONTRACT.md` in the same PR
   as the pin bump.
7. Run `swift test` locally on Apple Silicon before opening the PR (set
   `MANIFOLD_DISCOVER_LOCAL_MODELS=1` or `LLAMA_TEST_MODEL=<path>` to exercise
   the real-model suites).
